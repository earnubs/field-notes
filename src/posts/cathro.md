If you like a bit of the MTB you might also like this series from Ben Cathro
following the UCI DH World Cup. In it he talks about line choice and track
conditions plus other interesting news from each round. Here's his latest from
Fortwilliam (Day 3)

As will be fairly evident when you watch that, Ben Cathro is from Scotland,
which is where BKXC (who's from California, I think) was this week and
posted this video of Innerleithen, a video which has really made me want to cross
the channel for a wee day out in trails there, midges aside.
